\section{Introduction}

% Introduce this paper, It is a summary of ai disaster detection and problems using 5 primary papers (but hopefully more) ...
%% introduce the what remote sensing is
%% tell some statistics about how disaster are bad and increasing (the papers have lots of references)
%% more or less show that there is a great opportunity and need for better disaster response

\cite{elbohy2025fusion} etc...


\section{Implication of effective or ineffective disaster response}

% Disaster disproportionately effect the poor and economically vulnerable
% Can amplify existing inequalities in communities that don't have survellance or data collection. Or help mitagte it due to easier data collection
% Talking about how it could include socioeconomic data into the disaster response information (paper example)
% (paper example) from all of the introductions and discussion sections.

\section{Application of remote sensing in disaster response}

% This is the results section where we can describe the different application and some basic stats to show how well it can or cannot work (like in chinese mountain range paper)
% How we can use it to detect and classify damaged buildings (~3 paper examples)
% How we can use it for fire detection (2 paper examples)
% How we can use it for more general disaster detection (1 paper example)

\section{Challenges of using remote sensing for disaster response}

\subsection{Data availability}

% Using super sampling to make low res data more useful (paper example)
% Using genAI to make up synthetic data (paper example)

\subsubsection{Compute constraints}

% How it can be hard to run large models on limited hardware and bandwidth
% Embedded processing due to bandwidth contraints from satellites (paper example)
% Compute constraints on the ground and speed requirements (paper example)

\section{Conclusion}

% Summarise the main points
% That we can use remote sensing for disaster response
% That it can be great but there are still challenges
% The current challenges that it face
% Touch on future directions (like end to end disaster response, smaller models, more data sources etc)
