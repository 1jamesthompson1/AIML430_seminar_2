% Slide 1,2,3: Technical & Deployment Challenges
\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Technical \& Deployment Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1. Resource-Constrained Deployment and Real-Time Processing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deep learning models require substantial computational resources, making deployment on UAVs and embedded systems challenging due to limited processing power, strict energy constraints, and restricted communication bandwidth (Elbohy et al., 2025)
        \item Example: ConvNeXt achieved 99.05\% accuracy for wildfire detection but lacks practical deployment strategies for edge devices and integration with emergency alert systems
        \item Critical trade-off: high-accuracy models often exceed hardware capabilities, forcing compromises between detection performance and operational feasibility
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Technical \& Deployment Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2. Model Interpretability and Trust Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DL models operate as "black boxes," providing no transparency into their decision-making process for critical damage assessments
        \item Trust issues: Emergency responders hesitate to act on AI predictions when lives are at stake without understanding the reasoning
        \item Explainability attempts fall short: Grad-CAM++ visualizations often highlight irrelevant regions rather than actual structural damage, failing to provide meaningful explanations (Lagap \& Ghaffarian, 2025)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Technical \& Deployment Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{3. Cross-Event Generalization and Class Imbalance}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Kim et al. (2022) investigated the application of computer vision techniques for water-related disaster damage assessment using satellite imagery
      \item Performance drops: 85.9\% (in-domain) → 80.3\% (out-of-domain), indicating models struggle to generalize across different disaster contexts despite strong performance on familiar events
      \item F1 scores fall below 0.5 for floods and tsunamis (Sunda Strait: 0.164, Midwestern Flooding: 0.495) primarily because submerged buildings become invisible in satellite imagery, causing systematic misclassification
      \item Class imbalance: "New buildings" (180) vs "Not damaged" (625) samples creates strong prediction bias, while submerged structures are completely absent from the Philippines post-Typhoon Haiyan dataset.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


% Slide 4: Data Acquisition & Quality Challenges
\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Data Acquisition \& Quality Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1. Cost, Accessibility \& Temporal Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Very high-resolution satellite data is often limited, delayed, or cost-prohibitive due to cloud cover and operational constraints
        \item Trade-off dilemma: Higher spatial resolution satellites have longer revisit cycles that cannot meet disaster response timelines, while satellites with more frequent coverage lack the spatial detail needed for accurate damage assessment
        \item Promising solution: ESRGAN techniques can enhance low-resolution imagery, achieving 4-5\% accuracy improvements for damage detection without expensive very high-resolution data (Lagap \& Ghaffarian, 2025)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


% Slide 5: Data Acquisition & Quality Challenges
\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Data Acquisition \& Quality Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2. Atmospheric \& Environmental Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item VIIRS satellite detected only 14.8\% of 298 forest fires in Heilongjiang (2013-2020) due to cloud cover and transit timing (Jiao et al., 2023)
        \item Floods coincide with heavy cloud cover that obstructs Landsat and MODIS optical sensors
        \item Critical paradox: Disasters create the very conditions (smoke, debris, atmospheric disturbances) that compromise sensing capabilities when most needed
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


% Slide 5: Operational & Methodological Challenges
\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Operational \& Methodological Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1. Multi-Temporal Analysis \& Recovery Discrimination}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Must track structural changes across pre-disaster → event → post-disaster periods to distinguish damage vs recovery vs new construction
        \item Models consistently misclassify partially damaged and recovered structures as seen in the Philippines Typhoon Haiyan dataset. Models are also unable to separate disaster damage from seasonal/urban changes
        \item Vision Transformers can compare all three temporal frames but show inconsistent temporal reasoning across damage categories (Lagap et al., 2025)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}    
}



% Slide 5: Operational & Methodological Challenges
\namedframe{Dwayne Acosta}{Operational \& Methodological Challenges}{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2. Synthetic Data \& Training Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generated imagery achieves high metrics (96.7\% mAP50, 90.8\% F1) when using YOLO-based models on the Malaysian flood detection but suffers from cartoon-like artifacts requiring systematic filtering (Teoh et al., 2024)
        \item Volume restrictions and prompt engineering challenges limit scalability of synthetic data generation
        \item Cannot replicate complex physical disaster dynamics, environmental interactions, or temporal progression from pre to post-disaster
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
